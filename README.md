# GitHub Pages Portfolio Starter (static)

This is a ready-to-use static GitHub Pages portfolio starter you can upload to a new repository named `your-username.github.io`.

## What's included
- index.html, about.html, courses.html, projects.html, volunteering.html, contact.html
- assets/css/style.css
- assets/images/profile.png (placeholder)
- files/cv.pdf (placeholder)

## Quick steps to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub named: `your-username.github.io` (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload or push the files from this folder to the repository root (using Git or GitHub web UI).
3. Go to **Settings > Pages** in the repo and ensure the source branch is `main` (root). GitHub Pages will host the site at `https://your-username.github.io`.
4. Replace `assets/images/profile.png` with your real photo and update `files/cv.pdf` with your CV.
5. Edit the HTML files to add your real project links and text.

## Tips
- Keep project pages short: goal, role, tools, outcome, link to code.
- Commit often and preview the site after changes.
